## TODO (what I need help with)

### Settings
- Improve stucturing of interfaces
- Improve safety of ElectronStore (type and checking issues)
### General
- Better way to store default database schemes
- Improve folder structure (DataStore probably doesn't belong in models)
- Get a list of helpful browser arguments
